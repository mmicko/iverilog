 * The vvp_ipoint_t is an integral type that is 32bits. The low 2 bits
 * select the port of the referenced functor, and the remaining 30
 * index the functor itself. All together, the 32 bits can completely
 * identify any input of any functor.
 *
 * Outputs of functors are the heads of a linked list of all the
 * inputs that it is connected to. The vvp_ipoint_t in .out points to
 * the first port in the list. The .port[x] in turn points to the next
 * port, and so on. The last .port[x] contains the null vvp_ipoint_t
 * value zero (0). In this way, an output can fan out as wide as the
 * original design requires.
